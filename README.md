## **Scripts**

- ## **mktidy.py**
  - this script makes it easier to make folders for each file type in the same directory automatically
    (makes folder for each file type based on its extention and moves it to the related file autoamtically)
- ## **mktidy.py**
  - this script joins every video in the active directory (I ususlly use it for merging playlist videos into single video )
